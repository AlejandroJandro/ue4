=== Build UE4 TrueSky plugin ===

* Use UE4.sln (UE4.vcxproj).

* Soluton file must go to the folder where your UE4 installation is (UE4 root folder)
* Project file goes to Engine/Intermediate/ProjectFiles (i.e. folder where prj files were generated)
* Project contains "TrueSkyPlugin" folder in Engine/UE4/Plugins

* Build UE4 project.
* Build some game project (I build QAGame). Set that game project as a startup project in VS.
( If you want to debug, run the game project, not UE4. Otherwise you must manually attach the debugger to
a new process.)

TrueSkyPlugin currently loads "TrueSkyUI.dll" from %SIMUL%\exe\x64\VC11\Debug\TrueSkyUI.dll
This DLL further loads Qt libraries. For that, the PATH env-variable is extended by
%QTDIR%\bin
%SIMUL%\exe\x64
%SIMUL%\exe\x64\VC11\Debug

It also loads Qt style-sheet from
%SIMUL%\PlugIns\UE4\TrueSkyUI\qss
(Note that it's all temporary solution!)

Therefore before running UE4 you must properly set QTDIR and SIMUL env-variables

I do it by starting VS using following batch file:

@echo off
set SIMUL=%CD%\Simul
set QTDIR=C:\Qt64\Qt5.2.0\5.2.0\msvc2012_64
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\"
start devenv.exe


=== Build TrueSkyUI.dll ===

* Use %SIMUL%/PlugIns/UE4/TrueSkyUI/TrueSkyUI.vcxproj
It builds x64 DLL into %SIMUL%/exe/$(Platform)/VC11/$(Configuration)
However UE4 plugin currently loads debug version (from .../Debug folder) only!
* To build DLL you must build "qtwinmigrate" library first (in PlugIns/Qt/QtWinMigrate)
 [I don't know if dependencies are correctly set]
